# Milk-Quality-Prediction

***About dataset***

*This dataset is manually collected from observations. It helps us to build machine learning models to predict the ***Quality of Milk.***
This dataset consists of 7 independent variables ie pH, Temperature, Taste, Odor, Fat, Turbidity, and Color.
Generally, the Grade or Quality of the milk depends on these parameters. These parameters play a vital role in the predictive analysis of the milk.*

***TARGET COLUMN - GRADE***

*• Low
• Medium
• High*

***Inspiration***
*To leverage the benefits of machine learning in the dairy industry.*
